Budget Tracker

1. Expense Categories: Allow users to categorize their expenses (e.g., groceries, rent, utilities) for better organization and analysis.
2. Expense History: Implement a feature to store and display a history of past expenses, including dates, amounts, and categories.
3. Budget Visualization: Create visual representations of the budget data using charts or graphs to make it easier for users to understand their financial situation.
4. Budget Goals: Enable users to set budget goals for different categories or overall budget, and track their progress towards those goals.
5. Data Persistence: Implement functionality to store budget data (income, expenses, goals, etc.) locally or on a server so that users can access their budget information from different devices or sessions.
